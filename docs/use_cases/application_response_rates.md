## Context
Jobba has been seeking to implement a cold response rate calculator feature, along with a page with various other statistics, since the beginning of the project. Determining the effectiveness of ones application strategy and resume is a helpful and motivating metric for Jobseekers, and we hope to be able to provide helpful job seeking tips.

### What Do We Have Now?
- The app uses Gmail API integration and data processing techniques to capture a CSV download of email records with rejections and initial applications.

## Jobs To Be Done
At a high-level, hereâ€™s how statistics calculation can add value to the lives of Jobba users and Jobba overall:

**Cold Response Rate** - Users can determine the base effectiveness of their application strategy and compare with other users. It is a simple way of gamifying job applications, and providing a concrete metric for job seekers.

**Timeline Stats** - Statistics over a timeline, with number of applications, number of responses, and number of interviews listed. This would allow a user to decide whether they are working fast enough, and keeping a consistent effort towards their job search. It would also demonstrate abstractly the effectiveness of different strategies at different times.

**Community Baseline** - Some sort of community average to determine how much better or worse than other job seekers your strategy is performing (could be listed alongside the above stats). This would allow job seekers to identify whether they are meeting a minimum standard they wish to achieve, and perhaps seek suggestions or alter their strategy based on this knowledge.

**Tips to improve Cold response rate** - A checklist of job seeking aids such as resume improvement guides, networking tips,
