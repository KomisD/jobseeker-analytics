## How Can I Contribute?

This project uses **Google OAuth** for authentication. To run the app locally, youâ€™ll need to configure your own Google API credentials.  

### Clone the repo
1. On Windows: We recommend that you use WSL2. [Installation instructions here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/). 
2. On Windows: start WSL 
3. In GIthub, fork the repository
3. Clone this fork  using ```git clone [URL copied from fork on github]```
4. ```cd``` into the repo you just cloned

---

### Create a Google OAuth App 
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project (or use an existing one).  
2. Navigate to **APIs & Services** â†’ **Credentials**.  
3. If this is your first time creating credentials with this project, you will have to configure the OAuth consent screen.
4. On the OAuth Consent Screen page, scroll to "Test Users" and add yourself.
3. Click **Create Credentials** â†’ **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs**.  
4. Set the application type to **Web Application**.  
5. Under "Authorized redirect URIs," add:  
   - https://jobseeker-analytics.onrender.com/login
   - http://localhost:8000/login
6. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for later.  
7. Download and save your credentials locally to the parent folder for this repo in a file named ```credentials.json```

---

### Set Up Environment Variables
1. create a blank file called `.env`:  
   ```sh
   touch .env
   ```
2. Edit the `.env` file with your credentials:  
   ```ini
   GOOGLE_SCOPES='["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly", "openid"]'
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret-here
   COOKIE_SECRET=your-random-secret-here
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   REDIRECT_URI=https://jobseeker-analytics.onrender.com/login
   ```
   **ðŸ”’ Never share your `.env` file or commit it to Git!**  

---

### Install Docker
1. If this is your first time using Docker, install as below:
   - Install Docker. On Windows/Mac install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/). On Linux install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). 
   - Start Docker Desktop or Docker Engine
      - On Windows: make sure to select "Use the WSL 2 based engine" under Settings/general.
      - On Linux: you may need to take additional post-installation steps, see (here)[https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/]. 

---

### Run the App  
Start the app using Docker compose-up. The first time you run this locally it may take a few minutes to set up.
```
docker-compose up -d
```
Then, visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to begin testing the app locally.

You can view logs from the app by finding your container in Docker Desktop/Docker Engine and clicking on it. The app will automatically refresh when you make changes. 
---

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Not redirected after login?**  
  Double-check your `REDIRECT_URI` in both `.env` and Google Cloud settings.  
- **Invalid API key errors?**  
  Some Google APIs require API key restrictionsâ€”try generating a new unrestricted key for local testing.
